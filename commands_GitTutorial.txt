- We are knowledge workers
- We need version control, what we end up with a manual version control
- Can we automate this? (we need to know when the file was modified, what has changed, why it was modified, and who did the change)


== commands ==
git init #initializes git

git status #See the git status

touch file.html # to create a file

== Branching == 
Creates a copy of the file
Rule: One feature = one branch

git checkout NameofBranch #OR
git checkout -b NameofBranch #creates a new branch and switches to it

git branch -d NameofBranch #deletes branch
